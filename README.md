A Jupyter notebook focusing on applying machine learning models to predict type of crime 

The project was completed for the undergraduate course 'Machine Learning for Public Administration' offered by Korea University's Department of Public Administration.
We attempted to solve a societal problem. To reduce fatalities associated crime prevention, we decided to create machine learning models that would be able to predict whether a crime would be violent or non-violent. 
By optimising a DecisionTreeClassifier and RandomForestClassifier, the models reach an accuracy of 0.7976 and an F1-score of ~0.79. Further optimization of models is possible.
